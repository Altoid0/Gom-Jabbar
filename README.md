# MintKit
MintKit is meant to be a collection of primarily powershell scripts used for all phases of a red team engagement. While they can very well be used in official engagements, some of the scripts extend beyond a reasonable scope as the original use case for this project was for mock Red vs. Blue engagements. Historically, many of these scripts have been imported into CobaltStrike Beacons and executed from memory but they could be used in any manner.

## Initial Access
A basic set of convenient scripts for rudimentary initial access. These are largely quick solutions with little to opsec considerations.

## Persistence
Various complex and simple scripts to implement methods of persistence in the form of command payloads.

## Post Exploitation
Mixture of practicality and fun.
