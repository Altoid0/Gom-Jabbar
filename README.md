# Gom Jabbar
Gom Jabbar alludes to the poison-tipped needle from the Dune series. This repo is meant to be a collection of red teaming scripts that I've made for use in Red vs Blue competitions. The goal is to have a place to hold any meaningful scripts used for all phases of such a red team engagement. 
For the sake of your honor and job prospects do not use these anywhere else ðŸ’€.

## Initial Access
A basic set of convenient scripts for rudimentary initial access. These are largely quick solutions with little to no opsec considerations. Spray and pray is the name of the game.

## Persistence
Various scripts to implement various methods of persistence.

## Post Exploitation
Mixture of practicality and fun.
